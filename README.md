mounter2
========

Hello ALL version 1.3.6 is now out.

i wrote some error handling so now when the mount command
fails it will send an error back instead of telling you it is
still mounted.

thank you for your patience this is after all the first
project ive released so it goes slow as i learn

in the next release im going to have the option for a default
directory to mount from and also to.  thanks again for using this software.

----1.3.5 updates ----


now runs with gksu.

----1.3.4 updates ----

A lot of cosmetics fixes in this version

removed the close button and just added a menu item for it

cleaned up some of the files too 

gonna call this version a first release

----------------------------------------

in the tar.gz you will find the make file
and everything you need to build it
as well as the gpl v1.2 license
so removed the install script
also removed the older files as i considered
the 1.3 version incomplete.
--TODO--

after its compiled it can be run with ./mounter2
requires gtk and gksu

mounter2 is desgined to make mounting iso files
much simpler.  future versions will allow saving
a default directory in which you store your iso files.
