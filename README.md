mounter2
========

Hello ALL version 1.3.4 is now out.

A lot of cosmetics fixes in this version

removed the close button and just added a menu item for it

cleaned up some of the files too 

gonna call this version a first release

----------------------------------------

in the tar.gz you will find the make file
and everything you need to build it
as well as the gpl v1.2 license
so removed the install script
also removed the older files as i considered
the 1.3 version incomplete.
--TODO--
still havent made a pkgbuild for arch users
configure to run as user

after its compiled it can be run with ./mounter2
requires gtk and kdebase-runtimes

mounter2 is desgined to make mounting iso files
much simpler.  future versions will allow saving
a default directory in which you store your iso files.
